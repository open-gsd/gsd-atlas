# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-15)

**Core value:** Agents get correct, cited, current answers about the code and the platform they are building against, instead of guessing from stale training data or sweeping the repo with grep.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundations and Walking Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Grammar Tier, Store and stdio Host
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-16 — Phase 01 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Nine phases for full PRD 1.0 (M0-M6); M4 split into SDK facts (Phase 6), agent integration (Phase 7), dashboard and eval (Phase 8); M5 and M6 folded into Phase 9 to avoid a thin release phase.
- [Roadmap]: Walking skeleton first. Phase 1 ends with `gsd-atlas lang test` on a fixture module on all three OSes; Phase 2 opens by extending it to build-then-find through the real Indexer, store, Query and CLI.
- [Roadmap]: ADRs are ratified just before the first phase that needs them (schedule in ROADMAP.md Planning Notes); research gap amendments ride along with the ADR they touch.
- [Roadmap]: TypeScript 6.x adapter is the MVP; 7.x subpaths are feature-detected at runtime; `typescript@6.0.3` is bundled as a degraded fallback.
- [Roadmap]: Host is stateless; the stdio shim is the default client path. Tenant and a two-tenant smoke test exist from Phase 2 so Phase 4 is additive.
- [Roadmap]: "Beats grep" means fewer tokens at non-inferior accuracy; the free-alternatives scan precedes the Phase 3 eval; the eval design is pre-registered.
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 are independent and may run in parallel; Phase 7 waits on Phase 6 only for hook rule R3.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Windows and Linux behaviour is unverified (watchers, WAL first-open race, named pipes, Defender); no Windows hardware, so three-OS CI is the only check and must exist from Phase 1.
- TypeScript 7.0.x has no supported programmatic API and 7.1 will change it; keep the 7.x adapter feature-detected and degradable (Phase 3).
- Swift grammar misses the 0.5% parse-error budget on current upstream releases; upstream `main` needs a `scanner.c` patch. Measure bytes inside ERROR nodes, not file-level `hasError` (Phase 5).
- Eval power: at N=50, 80% accuracy needs about 46/50 to clear the lower bound; pooled, pre-registered non-inferiority design is mandatory (Phase 3).
- Phase 2 carries 32 requirements; plan it in dependency waves and be ready to split.
- PRD M5 gate (pooled eval on gsd-core, gsd-pi, gsd-path and the Swift app) has no requirement of its own; anchored on REL-04 in Phase 9 (consider adding EVL-04).
- Unconfirmed: Memtrace licensing status, a reported `node:sqlite` NUL-truncation bug (Node floor 24.15), Apple licensing of SDK packs.
- Criteria 6 and 15 need Xcode 27; use the `xcode-27` runner if available, else local self-attested gates.
